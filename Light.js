// Custom Light Block Implementation in EaglerCraft

// Define a custom Light Block with specific behavior
const lightBlock = {
    id: 'custom:light_block',
    name: 'Light Block',
    texture: 'invisible',  // Light block will be invisible (or use a blank texture)
    isSolid: false,         // Light block isn't solid (doesn't block movement)
    lightLevel: 15,         // Maximum light level
    interactable: false,    // Make it non-interactive (no right-click actions)
    
    // When the block is placed in the world, we can trigger specific behavior
    onPlace: function (player, x, y, z) {
        // This function could do additional things when the block is placed, if needed
        console.log(`Light Block placed at (${x}, ${y}, ${z}) by ${player.name}`);
    }
};

// Assuming EaglerCraft has a method to "register" custom blocks, this is hypothetical
function addCustomBlock() {
    if (typeof EaglerCraft !== 'undefined') {
        // Register the block with the environment (hypothetical registration method)
        EaglerCraft.addBlock(lightBlock); // You might need to adjust this based on EaglerCraft's actual API
        console.log('Light Block successfully added to the game.');
    } else {
        console.log('Error: EaglerCraft environment not detected.');
    }
}

// Call the function to add the block to the game
addCustomBlock();

// Use /give or a specific script to access this block (as it might not show up automatically in Creative inventory)
